localStorage.setItem("user_id", user_id)
localStorage.getItem("user_id")

localStorage.setItem("admin_id", admin_id)
localStorage.getItem("admin_id")


we can store user/admin ids between webpages 
so they don't have to sign in more than once

need to check user_id, if its false redirect them to the login page

logout button = localStorage.clear();
